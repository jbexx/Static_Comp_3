This project is our third Static Comp project. It is a fully responsive design using flexbox and setting media queries for break points at certain screen widths to continue a flow of an aesthetic layout. I designed the initial page for a  device with a screen width of 13". From there I scaled down and as the layout became tight and not aesthetically pleasing, I put a break point in with a media query and adjusted the layout to come back into a proper, usable design layout.
